The JavaScript program selects a random phrase and displays the phrase as blank boxes to the screen.
The player can then input guesses with each key selected by a click or by pressing the key
on the keyboard will disable. If it is correct, the letter will be displayed in the box.
If the guess is incorrect, a heart will be removed. If the game reaches five missed guesses,
the game will end. If the player figures out the phrase, a message will be displayed and
they may press start to play again.
