The JavaScript program selects a random phrase and displays the phrase as blank boxes to the screen.
The player can then input guesses with each key selected by a click or by pressing the key
on the keyboard will disable. If it is correct, the letter will be displayed in the box.
If the guess is incorrect, a heart will be removed. If the game reaches five missed guesses,
the game will end. If the player figures out the phrase, a message will be displayed and
they may press start to play again.

I added some custom color styling to the program by adjusting the css file.

Changed the header to blue from #3a3f58
Changed the background color of the letters when they're displayed to blue from #4ac0d5
Changed the background of the box to red from #f7a964
Changed the overlay text color to yellow from #FFFFFF
Changed the start overlay background color to blue from #3a3f58
